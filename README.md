## Description
**jSQL Injection** is a lightweight application used to find database information from a server.

It's **free**, **open source** and **cross-platform** for Windows, Linux and Mac and it works with Java from version 11 to 20.

![Kali Linux logo](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/raw/master/web/images/kali_favicon.png "Kali Linux logo") jSQL Injection is also part of the official penetration testing distribution [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org/) and is included in various other distributions like [Blackbuntu](https://blackbuntu.org), [Pentest Box](https://pentestbox.com/), [Parrot Security OS](https://www.parrotsec.org), [ArchStrike](https://archstrike.org/) and [BlackArch Linux](http://www.blackarch.org/).
